Project: A Relational Database Solution for Pizzeria's Order Management, Inventory Control, and Delivery Logistics

Business Question: How can Pizzeria improve its operational efficiency and customer experience through the implementation of a relational database schema for order management, 
inventory control, and delivery logistics?

Description: The Pizzeria database project aimed to streamline operations and enhance customer experience at Pizzeria, a popular destination for pizza enthusiasts. 
By designing and implementing a relational database schema, the project focused on key functionalities including order management, inventory control, and delivery logistics.

- For order management, the database model incorporated entities for capturing order details, customer information, and order status tracking. This allowed for efficient processing 
and tracking of customer orders, ensuring timely delivery and customer satisfaction.

- Inventory control was another crucial aspect addressed by the database schema. By monitoring ingredient quantities, managing stock levels, and predicting ingredient needs based on 
orders, the model enabled effective inventory management. This helped in reducing waste, optimizing stock levels, and ensuring the availability of ingredients for fulfilling customer 
orders.

Furthermore, the database schema included entities and relationships for delivery logistics management. This involved functionalities such as driver assignments and order tracking 
for delivery orders, ensuring smooth and efficient delivery operations.

Overall, the project aimed to enhance operational efficiency, improve inventory management, and elevate the delivery experience for customers at Pizzeria.
